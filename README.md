# Data-Acquisition-Module-PCB
6 Layer 50.00mm x 50.00mm PCB handling all incoming sensor data on the submarine

# Project Description 
This project is the design and fabrication of a 6-layer PCB to serve as the main data acquisition board for a human-powered submarine. The board's primary function is to collect real-time sensor data and provide visual feedback to the pilot via an LED system. It will interface with a barometer for depth and pressure measurements, as well as a temperature/humidity sensor for monitoring internal environmental conditions. The board will also be integrated with a separate tachometer design to measure propeller RPM.
